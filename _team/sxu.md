Hello! I'm Sandra, a grade 11 student who is currently attending Markville Secondary School. Ever since I can remember, I’ve been incredibly passionate about literature. Whether I’m chipping away at a novel or learning about the usage of rhetorical techniques, English has always been a subject that I can completely immerse myself in. This enthusiasm, combined with my near-constant desire to write, has allowed me to receive Ashton Meadows Public School's Literacy Award in 2018, as well as Markville Secondary School’s Top Mark Grade 9 Gifted English Award in 2019. When my eyes aren’t glued to a piece of literature, however, I can often be found drawing, worldbuilding, socializing, playing the piano, and, of course, eating sweets! I also love keeping a positive attitude, as I was previously a member of Markville Secondary School’s energetic Transition Activity Council. I’m excited to be tutoring English at Vantage, and I hope that students will gain both knowledge and fun memories!
