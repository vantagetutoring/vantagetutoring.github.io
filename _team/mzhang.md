Hi! My name is Matt, and I am a Grade 12 student at Upper Canada College. In my spare time, I enjoy playing tennis, swimming, hiking and cooking. I have some experience in tutoring English for around a year, and other lesser experiences in teaching as well. I have experience in math and academic programs, having done several math contests over a few years and having many awards. I intend to get to know students, and to understand them beyond a purely academic standing. I look forward to working with Vantage and students!
