Hey everyone! My Name is Kene and I am a mathematics tutor at Vantage Tutoring. Outside of school I enjoy riding my bike, reading fiction and learning more through the internet and educational videos. In school, I participate in many extra-curricular activities such as Model United Nations, DECA as well as Varsity Volleyball, Basketball and Rugby. This past year I was president of my school's DECA chapter and one first place overall in my category at the regionals event. For Model United Nations I am currently an executive, and in this past year, I competed in conferences at McGill and Harvard University where I placed first in my events at both competitions. This year I was elected to serve on my school's board of stewards (student government) as the community service steward and currently lead our school's community service efforts and over 100 club wide extracurricular program. I look forward to sharing my knowledge with other students through Vantage Tutoring!
