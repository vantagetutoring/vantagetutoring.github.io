Hi everyone! My name is Aveen and I am so excited to be a part of the Vantage team. Aside from doing schoolwork, I enjoy playing my flute and learning new pieces of music. I love discovering new food joints and spending time with my friends and family. As well, I enjoy reading novels in my spare time, especially outdoors in a peaceful forest. During quarantine, I have picked up baking and enjoy making sweets!I have over two years of tutoring experience in mathematics and English, teaching students as young as six to as old as seventeen. I am also a prefect at my high school, where I help organize and run multiple events such as Grade 9 Orientation and Parents' Night. As well, I hold a band manager position in my grade's band where I help run and organize the band and events. On top of English, I can speak Farsi, French, and have started learning Spanish. I am passionate about building connections with students because I strongly believe in the idea that students learn best when they have a good relationship with their teacher. I am looking forward to working with talented individuals and helping them fulfill their full potential.
