Hey there! My name’s Ming and I am extremely excited to have the rare opportunity to work at Vantage Tutoring to help your child achieve academic success! I am going into Grade 12 at P.A.C.E., a gifted school, and serve as a math, science, and english tutor here at Vantage.

My hobbies include swimming, playing the guitar, trivia, and history; I am also active in my school’s community as a member of both the DECA and Reach for the Top teams, the latter of which I have won many competitions. I have had many years of experience with tutoring a wide range of subjects, and can be flexible with the hours, teaching material, and homework. In my last year of school, before I go to university and planning to major in business, I would love to do my utmost to pass on the knowledge I have gained over my years of education to assist younger students towards their dreams!
