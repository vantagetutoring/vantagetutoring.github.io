Hi everyone! I'm Jason, a student in the IB program at Upper Canada College. I have been teaching coding (Scratch & Python) for over a year and also have experience working with younger children through volunteering as a counsellor at a STEM-based summer camp. In terms of hobbies, I enjoy going on bike trails, shooting hoops on my driveway, playing the piano and guitar, and learning about programming languages and computer hardware. I am also involved in my schoolâ€™s DECA and coding club as well as the rowing and badminton team. I look forward to working and engaging with students by sharing my knowledge and passion for coding!
