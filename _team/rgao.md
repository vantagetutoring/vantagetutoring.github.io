Hi! I'm Rosana, a grade 11 student at Markville Secondary School. In my spare time, I enjoy reading novels, dancing, exploring creative outlets, and trying new oatmeal recipes. While my hobbies are more artistic and imaginative, my academic pursuits are STEM-oriented. I frequently self-study intriguing topics outside of class; through this, I scored a 5 on the AP Calculus BC exam. I'm excited to be tutoring math here at Vantage, and I look forward to working with you!
