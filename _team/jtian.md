Hey guys! I'm Jayson, the founder, director, and web programmer of Vantage tutoring. I have been tutoring for over 4 years, and I am incredibly passionate of sharing my knowledge with others!

In terms of hobbies and extracurriculars, I'm involved in a variety of activites: playing volleyball with my team, coding various programs, composing music, digitally drawing comics, blogging, or reading biology articles! I'm also a bit competitive - I have won some piano, coding, writing, and chinese competitions, won some medals in provincial and national tournaments with my club team, and this year I am representing Canada to participate in the Virtual International Biology Olympiad!

I'm incredibly excited to organize an initiative like Vantage as not only I believe it will be meaningful to our community but also inspire younger students to do the same. Cheers and please contact me if you have any questions!
