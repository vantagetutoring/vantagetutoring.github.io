Hello! My name is Shelby, and I am a Math (and Latin) tutor here at Vantage Tutoring. I look forward to helping out students as well as sharing my love of learning, and I would be very excited if I ever get the chance to teach Latin!

I am experienced with many levels of various Math contests, often achieving awards of distinctions for certain contests multiple years in a row. I have been fortunate enough to participate at the American Regions Mathematics League held at Penn State University in 2019, a fun and valuable learning experience, and would have attended in 2020 if not for its cancellation due to COVID-19.

I am passionate in linguistics, having studied English, Cantonese, Mandarin, and French for more than 10 years. I have learned basic Spanish, having learned it for one year, and recently completed all three years of high school Latin during the last school year, earning a Level 3 University Preparation course credit in Classical Languages, and I would love to take Ancient Greek at school if I ever have the opportunity. I have a little knowledge of Korean and Sign Language, and in addition to Japanese, I am interested in further expanding my understanding of these languages. In my free time, I love to listen and make music, embrace my inner foodie, organize my Google Drive, and spend time with friends and family.
