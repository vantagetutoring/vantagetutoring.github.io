Hello! I'm Tiffany and I am an English and Science tutor at Vantage Tutoring. I love to help students build confidence and curiosity in subject areas that I'm passionate about. I have tutored all throughout highschool in a wide variety of academic areas, meeting a multitude of student needs and goals. I love working with kids and besides tutoring I've volunteered coaching tennis and at summer camps. I hope to use the qualities and skills I've developed from my experiences to form meaningful connections with my students and positively impact their academic journey. 

As for a few of my personal interests: I'm involved in many youth non-profit organizations, leading initiatives for causes that I am passionate about such as mental health. I'm interested in psychology and placed top 5 in HOSA provincials for Behavioural Health. My pastimes include reading, playing and listening to music, and creating art.
