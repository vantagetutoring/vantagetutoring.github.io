Hello! My name is Cheryl Geng and Iâ€™m currently a student in the Visual Arts at Unionville High School. I've always had a strong leadership and teaching role ever since a young age, helping out for over 5 years as a teacher's assistant and camp councillor.In terms of hobbies, I enjoy a variety of arts including dance, music (piano and alto saxophone), and of course, visual arts! In my free time, I also love learning about investing and entrepreneurship, as well as starting my own businesses! Other than that, I love sports as well, you can often find me on the badminton court, swimming pool, skating rink, or ski slopes! Many of my achievements stem from the passion I have for my hobbies, this includes coming in the top 3 for girls doubles at the York Region Athletic Association's badminton competition (2018-2019), top 20 at DECA provincials (2019-2020), the Duke of Edinburgh's Award, and consistently maintaining one of the top 5 averages within all my classes!I can't wait to work with you alongside an amazing Vantage Team to build something incredible!
