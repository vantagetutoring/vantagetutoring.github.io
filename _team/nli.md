Hello! My name is Noah, and I'm a Digital Media Tutor at Vantage Tutoring! I've been working with Digital Media for 5 years now, and am experienced in software such as Photoshop, Premiere Pro, Sony Vegas, Davinci Resolve, and After Effects. Additionally, I took Communications Technology in school for 2 years, which was a course that further developed my Photoshop and video editing experience. Outside of school, I participate in various activities such as video editing, computer science, and sports. I was on the Varsity Tennis team for 2 years, and recently finished 2nd for men's doubles in the YRAA Championships. In addition, I also was selected to be on Metro Elite's U17 rep basketball team. I'm extremely grateful for this opportunity, and look forward to teaching students all about Digital Media!
