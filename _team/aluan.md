Hi everyone! I'm Annie, a new ESL English tutor here. I am fluent in Mandarin, which helped a lot when I spent a year in the Homework Help Buddies program at the Richmond Hill Public Library, working with ESL students that have recently come to Canada. It was a fun experience, and I learned as much as I taught. In my free time, I like reading anything I can get my hands on, writing short stories, and listening to music. If I'm in a good mood, I might sit at my piano and play something for fun. I have a level ten RCM certificate, so my repertoire books are filled with interesting pieces. I am a prefect at my high school and a training coordinator at Bayview Model UN. Working with others is my strong suit, so I'm looking forward to working with you!
