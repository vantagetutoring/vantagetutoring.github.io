Despite my current lifestyle, I was born in Beijing, China and only immigrated to Canada when I was barely three years old. Due to my ethnical background and my elementary education, I am trilingual (English, Mandarin, French). Travelling is a huge aspect of my life, as my family and I try to travel every year to visit different places around the world. Perhaps it is because of this that I recognize the importance of language diversity and culture! To unwind, I like to spend time alone and scroll through Douyin or watch youtube videos. Other times, I play video games with my friends (like League of Legends or Minecraft). At school, I partake and have partaken in many clubs, such as Math Society, Robotics, DECA, HOSA, Me to We, and many many more! Outside of school, I enjoy competitive programming and game development. I have a few years of experience in terms of working with younger aged children as a volunteer. In addition, I have worked as a tutor for the languages (high school level French and ESL English). Although my experiences are still maturing, I believe both myself as well as the tutees will be able to gain valuable experience from getting involved at Vantage!
