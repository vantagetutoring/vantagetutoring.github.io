Hi! My name is Siya and I am a grade 11 student currently enrolled in the drama program at Unionville High School. I have always admired my teachers and tutors for the effort they put into my learning, and now I hope to do the same for others. Other than academics, I enjoy music (I sing and play the guitar), painting, and reading. Some of my favourite book genres are fantasy, historical fiction, and contemporary! I have been a member of the DECA and debate teams at my school, and have participated competitively for both. I am also very interested in law and often find myself reading and learning about world politics in my spare time. I am so excited to work alongside the Vantage team to help other students make the most of their education!
