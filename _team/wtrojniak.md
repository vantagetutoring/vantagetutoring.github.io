Hello everyone! My name is Will and I am a programming tutor for Vantage. Programming has been a long time hobby of mine and I have taught myself many different languages and frameworks including C++, C#, Java, Javascript and Python. I am also the division head of project development for the coding club at Upper Canada College.

In terms of sports, I have played hockey competitively for more than five years and I ski casually. My other hobbies include PC building and playing video games, but I also love a good fantasy fiction novel.

I canâ€™t wait to keep learning with everyone else here at Vantage!
