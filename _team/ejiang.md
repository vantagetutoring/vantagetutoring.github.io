Hello! My name is Evelyn and I am a science tutor here at Vantage Tutoring! I am currently a student in the TOPS Program, an enriched math and science program at Marc Garneau CI. .

Ever since I was young, great teachers, coaches, and mentors have helped me achieve success at school and in my extracurriculars. This provides the foundation for my commitment to helping younger students grow their love for science and achieve their academic goals as well. As a tutor, I have experience helping students with math and SSAT preparations. Furthermore, I am a teaching assistant at Kumon and have volunteered nearly 200 hours as a camp counselor at various camps.

Some of my hobbies include photography, playing the violin, and hiking. A few of my achievements include winning a bronze medal at HOSA nationals, placing top 8 in Biology Bowl, and placing top 20 in Canada on the AMC10, qualifying for the AIME. I also co-founded a non-profit organization dedicated to helping youth build their financial knowledge and skills.
