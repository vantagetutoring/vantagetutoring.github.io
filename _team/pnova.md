Hello! I'm Patrick Nova, and I'm a new French tutor here at Vantage Tutoring. I've been learning French for eleven years, and I had a three-month exchange trip to Bordeaux last year, which helped me become fully fluent in the language. On top of French, I speak English (evidently), Romanian, Spanish, and Mandarin. Outside of languages, I have a passion for the sciences, notably biology, and I am interested in pursuing a career in the field.
