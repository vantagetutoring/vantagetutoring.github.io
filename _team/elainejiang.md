Hi! I’m Elaine, a student in the International Baccalaureate program at White Oaks SS and an executive at White Oaks debate. I have one year of experience tutoring math and language, and I’m super excited to be pioneering the speech and debate course with Andrew at Vantage tutoring!Throughout the last 4 years, my participation in debate has not only grown my skills as a debater, but also as a student and a global citizen. I’ve been testament to the numerous benefits of debate: building presentation skills, gaining expertise, improving critical thinking, learning the art of argumentation, connecting with talented people, and having so much fun. One of the highlights of my debating experience has been breaking finals at this year’s Canadian National French Debating Championship (which was especially exhilarating because it was in french!).I have been quite privileged to have a nurturing debate community in and around my school - and I hope to bring the same support to you. During quarantine, I’ve built and participated in many online debate communities, supporting students in different parts of their debating journey. Aside from debate, I like to spend my time reading, baking, and playing a lot of music. As a clarinettist, I’ve enjoyed playing in the Toronto Youth Wind Orchestra, the Oakville Symphony, the Mississauga Symphony Youth Orchestra, and the Oakville Symphony Youth Orchestra.
