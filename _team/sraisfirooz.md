Hi everyone! My name is Sana, and I'm an IB student who has always had a passion for learning. I'm excited to be a part of Vantage Tutoring and help students reach their potential!  
  
I have an abundance of experience tutoring primarily from being a First Aid and Swimming Instructor at swimming facilities. During this time, Iâ€™ve had the chance to teach various personalities and have consequently become experienced teaching various group sizes effectively. In fact, during the pandemic, I started teaching online classes with 1-55 students on how to identify/treat diverse medical issues. In addition, last year I was a science tutor at my high school. I was also a French and Music teacher assistant in grades 9-10 which demonstrates my long-term experience and interest in teaching others.  
  
I also attended the YRDSB science competition where I won the Silver award for chemistry. A fun fact about me is that I'm also interested in business - I even won Provincials last year for my category, qualifying for Internationals in the USA. Furthermore, I'm in my school's band as a clarinetist and the Co-President of the Engineering Club.
