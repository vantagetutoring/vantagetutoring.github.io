Hi everyone! My name is Eric and I am a coding tutor here at Vantage. I have been tutoring for around 4 years now and I love getting to meet new people and sharing my knowledge with others!

In terms of hobbies and extracurriculars, I’m involved in a variety of activities: hockey, volleyball, tutoring/teaching, DECA, programming and so much more! I’m excited to be helping out wherever and whenever needed!
