Hello! My name is Stacy and I’m in the Arts Unionville Piano Program at Unionville High School. I’ve been playing the piano for over ten years and I’m currently working on my ARCT certificate at the Royal Conservatory of Music. 

Throughout my career, I’ve been able to achieve various awards in piano, figure skating, and math competitions—both regionally and provincially. In my academics, I’ve been able to obtain honour roll and subject awards, score in the top 98 percentile on the SAT, and am currently studying 5 AP subjects. One of my biggest achievements outside of school is founding Justice For Society Magazine, an organization dedicated to raise awareness and educate others about on-going social issues. I currently hold leadership positions in organizations such as the Youth Political Assembly, FCSS-FESC, Future Lawyers, and Youth of Canada.

Currently, I am looking forward to going into business in the future. As a result of my passion for this subject and its demands in critical thinking, I currently hold top marks in my classes; I truly believe that education is vital in today’s society. On that note, I’m super excited to work with everyone and share my knowledge with other students!
