Hey everyone! My name is Jeff Liu and I am an International Baccalaureate student at Milliken Mills High School. I am Quadra-lingual and have lived in three different countries throughout my life. I am thrilled to serve as the ESL English tutor here at Vantage and I hope to have a great experience with y'all. Some of my hobbies include: volleyball, architectural design, reading mystery novels, and exploring different languages. I have 2 years of experience in professional translation with a publishing firm in Shanghai in which I translate children's books and novels. I have been involved with a mentorship program offered by the City of Markham since 2017 that assists young children in ESL learning and I am familiar with ESL curriculums from kindergarten SK all the way to grade 10. These experiences also enabled me to achieved some translation prizes and writing awards for English, Mandarin, and Cantonese.
