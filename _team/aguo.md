Hi! I'm Anya and I'm a grade 11 student in the Arts Unionville music program at Unionville High School. I recently began tutoring and have experience in teaching Math and English. When it comes to achievements, I had the highest overall average in my grade during the 2019-2020 school year and have also won multiple awards in DECA including top 20 in the province in 2nd in York Region. Additionally, I grew up competing in math contests and have placed in the top 5% of Canada. Outside of academics, I'm one of the Co-Presidents of a community MEDLIFE chapter and an executive team member of my school's DECA chapter. Music is one of my greatest passions hence the immense amount of time I spend playing various instruments (french horn, piano, trumpet and guitar) and participating in music ensembles, such as the Ontario Provincial Honour Band. In my spare time, I enjoy baking, reading books, bullet journaling, listening to true crime podcasts and spending time with my family and friends. I'm extremely interested in health sciences and hope to become a pediatrician or internist in the future. I look forward to working with students here at Vantage!
