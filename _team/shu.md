Hello there! I'm Sherry, an incoming g12 student at Unionville High School enrolled in the SHSM Business program. One of my passions is financial literacy, as I believe all young adults should have the knowledge they need to manage their money and achieve financial freedom. Currently, I'm the Director of Sponsorships for Target Alpha STC as well as the Business Lead/Vice President of my school's robotics team. I'm also the Head Trainer for the school's DECA chapter, where I teach students topics like business, presentation skills, and report-writing skills. Just this year, I qualified as a DECA ICDC Finalist and Top 10 Competitor in the event of Finance Operations Research. 

At school, I've received subject awards in math, English, geography, French, science, and business technology. I'm also an avid learner outside of school, and have taken courses in Accounting, Financial Valuation, Epigenetics, as well as several AP courses. In my spare time, I enjoy reading (sci-fi is my favourite genre), bullet-journalling, and looking into new innovations in the tech field. I look forward to working with the Vantage team to help make education services more accessible and student-friendly!
