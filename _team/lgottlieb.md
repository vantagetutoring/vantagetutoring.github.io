Hello! My name is Lauren, and I am delighted to be tutoring alongside Vantage. This will be my third official year tutoring (but the eighth unofficial year, as I frequently tutor my three younger siblings). I am experienced in and love teaching maths and sciences. My hobbies include playing and coaching for Canadian Girls Baseball, skateboarding, and memorizing the Periodic Table. At school, I am on the Head's List as well as a member of the Math Society and Science Club. If you couldn't already tell, my biggest passion is science, so I also love to research anything to do with chemistry and biology in my spare time. When the pandemic first hit and we were all stuck at home, I took up some extra online courses, including: "The Anatomy of the Chest, Abdomen, and Pelvis" at Yale and "An Introduction to the biology of cancer" with Johns Hopkins. I very much look forward to empowering others to love and appreciate their education as much as I do!
