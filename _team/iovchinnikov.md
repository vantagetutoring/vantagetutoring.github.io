For the last 4 years, I have worked as a math and physics tutor both in and outside of the school environment, developing many personal teaching strategies along the way. I am currently the Coordinator of the Science Tutoring Program and Vice-President of the Physics Club at Bayview secondary. I have had close experiences with research, as part of a Co-op with the McMaster University Department of Engineering Physics. I am also actively involved in our Music Department as a flute player, Band Manager, Music Council Co-President and Music Tutoring Program executive. I have privately studied piano for 10 years. In my free time I study history of the 20th century through memoirs and online documentaries. I am a fluent in Russian and know some basic German .
