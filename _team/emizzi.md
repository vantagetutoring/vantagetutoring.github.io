Hello, Emily here! I'm currently an IB student at Bayview Secondary, and recently I've been given the exciting opportunity to work as a French tutor at Vantage. I've spent eight years of my life as a French Immersion student, and I'm thrilled to be given the chance to share my knowledge with some bright young minds. To tell you a little about me, I'm heavily involved in my school's music department. Besides playing bass clarinet for our regular band, I also perform in Chamber Orchestra and occasionally sing in Jazz Band. Additionally, I have been playing piano for about nine years now, and over the years, I've racked up my fair share of first-place competition trophies. My other hobbies include a LOT of reading (especially during quarantine), drawing and painting, watching movies, cycling and caring for my many plants.
