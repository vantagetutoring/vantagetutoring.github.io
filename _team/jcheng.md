Hello everyone! I'm Joline, a first-year mathematics student at the University of Waterloo, planning to major in mathematical physics. I have been a teaching assistant at Kumon for more than two years for students of all ages. I'm experienced in mathematics contests as well and have received multiple awards of distinction all four years of high school. My achievements in contest math have actually clasped me a scholarship from my university! I'm also quite versed in science and have won awards in chemistry and physics contests. Aside from my academics, I am a lover for the sports. I used to swim competitively and I currently run cross-country. I actually ran a half-marathon last year! In the winters you can find me snowboarding down some slopes - a hobby I self-taught myself. I've been a volunteer at my local hospital for over three years and have worked approximately 450 hours there. I also play the trumpet and was part of my school's symphonic and jazz bands. I'm incredibly excited to be part of the Vantage team and can't wait to help students achieve their full potential!
