Hey! My name is Chris King, I am a first-year computer engineering student at the University of Ottawa. I have been teaching computer programming to students of all ages and skill levels for over two years. I have experience in a variety of programming languages including Java, C/C++, Python, and JavaScript and have created many different projects ranging from simple discord bots to more complex video games. 

Aside from programming, I enjoy playing music. I play drums, bass, and guitar in multiple different bands with all sorts of different styles.

I am very excited to be a part of the Vantage team and I look forward to helping students succeed!
