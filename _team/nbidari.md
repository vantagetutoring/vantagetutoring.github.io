Hello! I'm Nima, a coding tutor. I've tutored math and english for one year previously, and am excited to start teaching coding and science for Vantage!

I've been coding with Python, JavaScript, Java, MATLAB, Octave, and GDscript for about 5 years, ranging from video games to AI to AI for video games. In terms of hobbies, I love playing guitar, bass, and piano, in all sorts of genres from metal to funk, and I play in the Senior Jazz Band and am part of the Musical's Pit Band. I will be playing Varsity Football and Rugby this year, as well (if and when possible).

I'm excited to be working with the Vantage team to try and pass on some of my knowledge.
