Hello everybody! I am just beginning my third official year of tutoring (unofficially I have been tutoring my little brother for 8 years!). I have taught a wide variety of academia, including the sciences, English, French, and mathematics. French and science will be the subjects I will teach with Vantage! As for as hobbies go, I regularly play chess, read books, memorize pi, play the piano or the Alto saxophone, and work on my mental math. I have ranked in a large number of local, provincial, national, and even international math contests throughout the years, my most memorable being the Math League Summer Tournament in the College of New Jersey. 

I have an avid interest in biology, hoping to pursue a career in the field. This year I was accepted into Harvard Summer School and planned to study epigenetics, but had it canceled as a result of COVID-19. I play soccer semi-professionally, and compete annually in soccer tournaments in the U.S.A, however one year my team and I participated in an international soccer tournament in Italy called the San Marino Cup! I love being involved in my school community, taking part in clubs and activities such as Math Club, Chemistry Research Club, Biology Research Club, STEM Fellowship, Business Team (Including DECA), the soccer, volleyball, and track teams, as well as leadership roles - I will be a House Captain for my school this year! Personally, I have always loved tutoring and I am looking forward to being a part of this team! I aspire to have a great time teaching, working, and above all, learning with you guys!
