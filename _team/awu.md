Hello! My name is Angela, and I'm an ESL English tutor here at Vantage. 
I'm very excited to be tutoring for a second year!

I'm an executive member of three different clubs and also a prefect at my high school. I'm currently learning Mandarin, and have been for 13+ years, which led me to volunteer for 100+ hours at the York Region District School Board International and Indigenous Languages program. 
A few of my hobbies include reading lots of mystery books, listening to podcasts, and recently knitting! 

I look forward to supporting each and every student throughout their learning journey!
