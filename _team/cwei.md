Hi! My name is Chantel and I am an art/math teacher at Vantage tutoring. I love teaching and working with kids in kindergarten, elementary, and middle school, which I have done before at an educational summer camp as a counselor. Additionally, I am currently enrolled as a peer tutor at Unionville High School for the Business Leadership course!

I enjoy drawing, both traditionally and digitally, and am skilled at crafts such as resin casting and sculpting from polymer clay. I have also been reading a lot of books recently, which most of them are in the genres of finance, business mindset, or mystery. Finally, I also like playing video games, where I create videos on them using software such as OBS and Adobe Premiere for streaming and video editing. 

As a high achiever in academics, I have gotten the honour roll every semester at Unionville High School. Asides from that, my other achievements include being able to attend events such as Youth Mental Health Canada’s community fair, due to being able to create my own business, and being the Vice President at my school’s Community Council in the 2019-2020 year.

I am super excited to work with all of you!
