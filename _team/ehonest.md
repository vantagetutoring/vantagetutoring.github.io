Hey everyone! My name's Ethan, and I'm super excited for this opportunity to help out students of all ages on their journeys towards academic success. Some of my hobbies include programming games, playing sports, and speedcubing (solving Rubik's Cubes as fast as possible).

Over the past several years, I've had experience in peer tutoring, teaching a wide range of friends and colleagues in multiple fields. I've also organised several extracurricular activities, such as Rubik's Cube and Card Clubs, to allow kids to explore a variety of potential interests and activities. This upcoming year will be my last year of high school before university, where I plan to major in Computer Science. I would love to be able to share some of my experience with the next generation of students, and provide them with the knowledge they need to succeed.
