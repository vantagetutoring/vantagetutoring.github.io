Hey everyone! I'm Farin and I am currently a student at The Academy for Gifted Children- P.A.C.E. I have been tutoring for 2 years and have jad various roles in which I serve as guidance towards youth. 

At school, I am part of sports teams (volleyball, ultimate frisbee), robotics, and model UN. I have also created an arts and crafts club for grades 1-3. 

Aside from academics, I have been pursuing different hobbies such as horseback riding, singing, and drawing.

As for my achievements, I have recieved a full Delf diploma, a singing scholarship to the Upper Canada Chorus, acceptance into The Meadows Equine riding academy, and a silver Commonwealth award.
I'm very excited to be a part of Vantage tutoring and look forward to work with talented individuals.
