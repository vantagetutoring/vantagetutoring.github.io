Hello! I'm Nicole Fan, and I'm beyond excited to be tutoring at Vantage! I've always loved working with students, and I cannot wait to connect with my fellow tutors. One of my greatest interests is mock trial and law, and I've participated in numerous international mock trial competitions throughout these past few years. Recently, my team ranked as Top International School, and I was even able to rank as the top attorney for a number of our trials! Aside from mock trial, I enjoy immersing myself in chemistry and expressing myself in French -- this could be through poems, magazines, and speech competitions! On top of French, I speak English, Mandarin, and can get by in Spanish -- Iâ€™m always eager to learn new languages. 

Outside of school, I love playing tennis, discovering new music, and connecting with friends! Thank you so much for reading, and I look forward to the amazing work that will be accomplished at Vantage!
