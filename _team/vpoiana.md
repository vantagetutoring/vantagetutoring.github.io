Hey everyone! I'm Vanessa, a Grade 12 tutor at Vantage Tutoring. I'm quite experienced with tutoring as I've been doing it for three consecutive years.

In terms of the subjects I tutor, for French, I have my DELF B2 certification which meets the language requirement for admission to universities in France. My prefered branch of science is Physics so I participated in an Astrophysics course at Harvard Summer School. I aspire to study engineering in the future.

Aside from school, I have several interests and hobbies. I enjoy creative writing, basketball, painting, podcasting, playing piano and guitar, and skateboarding.

As for achievements, I have made the honour roll for a variety of writing, chemistry, math, and logic competitions. In addition, I placed top 2 at DECA provincials and won a Mock Trial award at my school. Furthermore, I have been accepted in the CTY program at Johns Hopkins University, Duke TIP, and the Center for Talent Development at Northwestern University.

I'm so thrilled to have the opportunity to share my knowledge with bright young minds and have a hand in helping them reach their full potential.
