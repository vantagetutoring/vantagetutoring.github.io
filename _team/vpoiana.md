Hey everyone! I'm Vanessa, a Grade 11 tutor at Vantage tutoring. I'm new to tutoring as I've been doing it for just under a year.

Aside from school, I have several interests and hobbies. I enjoy painting, playing piano and guitar, skateboarding, basketball, and I dabble in creative writing and podcasting.

As for achievements, I have made the honour roll for a variety of writing, math, and logic competitions. In addition, I made the top 20 at DECA provincials and won awards at Mock Trial competitions for my school. I have been accepted in the CTY program at Johns Hopkins University, Duke TIP and the Center for Talent Development at Northwestern University.

I'm so thrilled to have the opportunity to work with all these bright young minds and have a hand in helping them reach their full potential.
