Hi everyone! Iâ€™m Kelly, an ESL English teacher. I have been tutoring for 2 years and have just recently started teaching English to students from China, as I am fluent in both English & Mandarin. Aside from academics, I enjoy dancing, reading and travelling. As for achievements, I have received certificates from multiple math contests and was also an ICDC qualifier for the 2020 DECA provincials. I look forward to working with the Vantage team and helping students further their knowledge!
