Hi everyone! My name is Alex and I am currently a Grade 12 student at Upper Canada College. At Vantage, I work with the executive team to manage and recruit new tutors. 

I’m quite passionate about STEM and most of my activities involve maths and sciences. I’ve participated in math competitions since Grade 3 and have won several distinctions and honours. In the sciences, I’m most passionate about chemistry/biology and hope to use this knowledge to pursue a career in medicine in the future.

Outside of STEM, I enjoy drawing as it takes my mind off of the stresses of the IB program. In a similar nature, I’ve recently gotten into biking and hope to complete a long distance bike ride this summer.

It is truly an honour to be a part of Vantage and I look forward to working with everyone this upcoming year!
