Hey there! I’m Carolyn, a grade 11 student currently enrolled in the music program at Unionville High School where I play the alto saxophone. As a music student, working with others and helping my peers has always come naturally. Whether it be help with something music related like a difficult passage in a piece or something academic based like math, I’m always there to assist anyone. With over four years of experience in different ensembles including the Toronto Youth Symphony Orchestra and the Ontario Provincial Honour Band, I’d love to take that affinity for teaching and all the lessons I’ve learned to spread my knowledge and passion for music! 
Apart from music, I’m also an executive of my school’s DECA chapter where I have more than two years of competition experience at a provincial level. I also love to bake, figure skate, and help plan events in various councils in and out of school. I’m super excited to be part of the Vantage team and hope to truly inspire and help students!
