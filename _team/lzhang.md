Hi! My name's Leo, and I'm a content lead here at vantage tutoring. I work together with our executive team to make sure Vantage is able to provide tutoring to everyone. My experience lies in computer related activities- I intern at a computer science startup and help out with several clubs at school. I also do a lot of debate, winning awards at some local and national level tournaments. I also do competitive swim, and will be on the Varsity team this coming winter season to participate in OFSAAs. In my free time, I'm learning to play the guitar, and (regretfully) play league of legends. It's great to be part of Vantage and I look forward to working with the others in the coming and final year of high school.
