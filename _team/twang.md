Hello! My name is Thomas and I’m psyched to be teaching here at Vantage. Previously, I have volunteered for the City of Markham where I spent hours teaching youth the basics of chess. In addition, I have tutored fellow students in math (grade 9). In terms of achievements, I have received distinctions in a myriad of national mathematics contests, co-founded the Milliken Mills Math Club, and ranked top 100 on DMOJ (a modern contest platform and archive of programming problems). Furthermore, I have attended hackathons such as MasseyHacks and I am currently working on a project for Hack The North, Canada’s biggest hackathon. During my spare time, I enjoy coding on various online judges, playing chess, hanging out with friends, binge-watching TV shows, and of course, playing video games (primarily League of Legends). As a tutor, I look forward to sharing the knowledge I have gained over the years and having some fun along the way!
