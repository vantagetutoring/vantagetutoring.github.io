Hello! My name is Leanne, and I am a tutor here at Vantage Tutoring. I have been tutoring for three years now, and I can’t wait to continue helping students in mathematics and science with this incredible team. When I’m not studying, I can often still be found with my head over a book. As an avid bibliophile, another pastime of mine is wandering around the local Chapters with iced coffee in hand, typically year round. I also enjoy playing billiards, ping pong and ultimate; although, admittedly, it has been a while since I’ve even touched a cue, paddle or disc. Among friends, I have gained the reputation of the ever-dependable “mom friend” and the overly-analytical strategist in (and winner of) card games. 

I look forward to accompanying you on your learning journeys and providing any assistance I can!
