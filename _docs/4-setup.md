Class times each week don't need to be set in stone and are flexible, but a one-class per week minimum is required. Please confirm you're 100% able to commit. You can choose to stop or start teaching a new course after each 8 week period, however you cannot drop out half way through. 

*Negotation of emergency class cancellation can be discussed and an extra week to the 8 week can be added, but only under special circumstances.*

You will access the class link, student notes, teaching resources, thorugh our Dashboard once you are verified. Payment will be through email transfer at the end of the eight week period. We are also able to sign volunteer hours in substitute, under the submission of volunteer forms at the end of your class period.

8-week courses have a curriculum and outline with starting dates and deadlines. You can select courses (2 courses, 2-4 hour / week commitment maximum) offered with varying dates, subjects, and students. Classes range from 1 - 4 students. *A trial class with another tutor will be offered for interested students to both ensure interest of student and how well you teach*
