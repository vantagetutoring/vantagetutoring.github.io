Common questions and answers for new tutors!

<details>
    <summary>How is tutoring done? Online?</summary>
    <p>Yes! As it is the pandemic, we are tutoring virtually! We may expand to physical tutoring when it gets safer but right now we are online. We use either google meets or Zoom, which is monitored by our exec and management team.</p>

    <summary>How much do I get paid? How will I get paid?</summary>
    <p>Depending on the course type that you teach you earn a minimum rate of 12-20 dollars. On top of that, there may be comissions and bonuses depending on the time that you teach.</p>
    <p>You receive payment at the end of every term (8 classes). We can pay you through paypal, email transfer, and hopefully cash once the pandemic ends :)</p>

<details>
    <summary>Do I have to design courses on my own? What about tutoring content?</summary>
    <p>The default model for our tutoring is focused on the student. We want to provide a personalized plan for each student to help them grow and focus on their specific needs to improve.</p>
    <p>We have tons of resources that can help you design your class curriculum, but the course itself is designed by you with the help of our exec members. This is to ensure that the course is specific for the student you are teaching. We have a bank of resources that past tutors have created, and if it fits the needs of your student you may recycle it, but if there are none that are suitable for your students level, you will need to create resources by yourself.</p>
