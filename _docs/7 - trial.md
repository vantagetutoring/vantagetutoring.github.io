The trial class is ...
- to see if the student likes you as a tutor and is suitable for your teaching style
- to see if the tutor would like to teach the student
- to assess the students level in order to make a course plan / curriculum (if needed)
- 45 - 60 minutes long
- should be friendly, relaxed conversation

### Trial Class Structure

<div class='flex'>
<div>
    <p>Although the trial class can be structured any way you like, we suggest you create a slideshow. Most of our tutors use <a href='https://www.canva.com/'>Canva</a> as it looks nice. Google slides works fine as well. </p>
    <p>We also have a suggested outline that tutors can follow:</p>

</div>

1. Introductions
    - getting to know the student's basic information, introduce yourself
2. Icebreaker Games
    - Playing a game / interactive activity that matches the tutoring subject (e.g. English - two truths one lie, would you rather / Math - interesting puzzle / problem )
3. Tell the student the structure and what is going to happen for the rest of class
4. Mini-assessment
    - Assess the student's skills based on their grade level and the tutoring subject.
    - For language courses, try to cover the four aspects of every language: speaking, writing, listening, and reading comprehension
    - For math courses, try to test different skills and areas. If the student is in grade 6, we would suggest preparing assessment questions between grade 5 - grade 8
    - Reassure the student this is not a test! So if they are struggling in one level, feel free to just focus on a level you find that will suit them
    - Depending on the age, tutors may want to make this assessment a game or interactive scenario
        For example, assessing student's ability to do fractions can be turned into a story about making a pizzeria
5. Reflection
    - Reflect on the class with the student (if they are old enough)! How did they like it? How could have it gone better? 
    - Evaluate their strength and weaknesses, ask them how they feel about the subject. Are they comfortable with it or do they dislike it? What reasons?
6. Finish class! Tell them we will get in contact with them soon and congratulate them!

These are just examples of things to consider! Feel free to use any of these ideas in structuring the student's trial class.

### Things To Consider

- Student age. Is the structure appropriate for their age level? Will they be engaged or bored?
- Student personality. In the first 5 minutes of class, you should already have a good sense of how the student is like. Are they attentive? Not so talkitive? Excited? You should adjust your teaching style according to how they react. For example, a tutor should be very cheerful and excited and would want to encourage more hands on activities / interactions if the student seems to be losing their attention.


### Sample Trial Class Slides

Below is an example of a trial class for Grade 3 English that [Sandra Xu](https://vantagetutoring.org/team/sxu) has created! Take a look for inspiration. Of course, the structure and wording of the slides would vary depending on the student's age and the tutoring subject.
