### How does tutoring at Vantage work?

This section is for tutors who have just joined us, and we hope to explain everything in these docs. Here are some basic points about how classes work:
- Currently virtual, on Google Meet or Zoom, depending on the preference of the tutor or students.
- Most classes are private 1 on 1, group classes are created if more students are interested.
- Classes are grouped into terms, each term consists 8 classes. Tutors usually focus on 1 unit for each term.
- Minimum 1 hour of class per week, times are flexible.
- Class cancellation is allowed for students, must communicate cancellation 3 days minimum before the scheduled class.
- Our goal is to help students by providing __personalized__ help to the student!
- Classes may either be helping the student with homework OR teaching the student, where you will prepare lesson slides / homework (if requested).
- We have resources and a drive with created lessons from past tutors. These can help you when designing a course for your student.





### Is there anything I need to do? 

Here's checklist to make sure you are ready to start class:

1. Review the [__terms and agreements__](/docs/9-terms)
2. Complete your __tutor profile__ (we will provide you the form via email)
3. Join our __Discord Server__. This is madatory as this is the main tool of communication we will be using. If you have not done so, please read the doc on [discord page](/docs/8-discord)
4. Sit back and wait! Once we match you with a potentially interested student, one of the management staff will contact you through the __Vantage DISCORD server__.
