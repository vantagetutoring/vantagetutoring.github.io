            <h2>Our company</h2><br>
        We are a group of high schoolers based in Toronto who want to provide both high quality and relatable learning for students. Our team is a dedicated group of high schoolers who enjoy teaching and helping the younger generation. We want to make a platform
        where we, as high schoolers, can help shape the academic paths of younger students with our experience and passion for learning - so that they embark on an easier, more effective, and enjoyable learning journey.
