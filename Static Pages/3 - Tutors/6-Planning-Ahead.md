Our team is extremely excited as we have recieved great interest in tutors over the past week since our launch date.

## Our Hiring Model

1. All interested tutors are placed into our hiring list based on a range of factors like subject need, grades, and hobbies. This model has been used as we are currently hiring **based on demand**.
2. Interested tutors will recieve an email with an invitation to setup a profile using the tutor dashboard. We will assume you are no longer interested if you have not setup a profile within 3 days and will give the opportunity to the next person.
3. Once your profile has been verified, you are officialy a tutor! Welcome to the team, and you will gain full access to the dashboard. We will contact you from there!



Our tutoring model is either one on one or small groups depending on subjects.
