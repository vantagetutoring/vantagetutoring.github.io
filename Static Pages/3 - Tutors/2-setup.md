# Important Things

Class times each week don't need to be set in stone and are flexible, but a one class per week minimum is required. Please confirm you're 100% able to commit. You can choose to stop or start teaching a new course after each 8 week period, however you cannot drop out half way through. 

*Negotation of emergency class cancellation can be discussed and a extra week to the 8 week can be added, but only under special circumstances.*
