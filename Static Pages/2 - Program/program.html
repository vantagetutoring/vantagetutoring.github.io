<h2>Homework Help</h2>

<p>What tutoring is all about! We help students with their work from school or another extracurricular. We assist them in a range of subjects and provide them with support. We also use technology (interactions / games) to better enhance learning and interest.</p>

<h2>Standard Courses</h2>
<p>We provide a custom course based on the students level and experience in the subject. Standard courses cover school subjects and all content is based on the official Ontario Curriculum, however we do use many textbooks and other resources for reference. We design our homework and lesson notes from scratch and use our personal notes if we've taken the course before. We can connect students with tutors so they can questions regarding the lesson or homework outside of class.</p>

<h2>Premium Courses</h2>
<p>Premium courses focus on a specific skill of extracurricular commonly seen outside of the typical academic classroom. We offer skill based courses like debate, arts (visual and digital), and coding. Our tutors are experienced with these subjects as they're our hobbies and we have probably worked in that subject to achieve something outside the classroom! We're design these courses based on experience as well as guidance from our professional teachers.</p>

<h2>Workshops</h2>
<p>Workshops are for students who want to get a better glance at what a certain high school or high school program is like. We offer Q&A sessions, and workshops for certain entrance exams like the IB entrance, TOPS, MACS, UTS, and SSAT exam. We have students who are in the programs and have first hand experience of what's it like and how to get in. We provide notes and worksheets in our workshop sessions and offer group communication and discussion.</p>
