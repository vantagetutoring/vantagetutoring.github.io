The Alley is a Taiwanese-based modern bubble tea chain known for their Brown Sugar Deerioca (tapioca pearl) drinks. The Alley’s trendy and unique branding starting with their signature logo – a male deer or buck head – has made it a social media darling.This cafe, the first Canadian location of a fledgling Taiwanese chain, offers creative teas and other beverages in an inviting space filled with exposed brick and lots of wood. The vibe is definitely more relaxed than your average bubble tea shop.
